                        <p>SINGAPORE, Dec 31 (Reuters) - A decade-old commodity boom came crashing to an end in 2015, hurting energy and mining companies and punishing prices as China's industrial rise and appetite for raw materials slowed. The outlook for 2016 is not much better.</p>

                        <p>The Thomson Reuters Core Commodity Index &lt;.TRJCRB&gt; fell by a quarter over the year to hit its lowest level since 2002 in December, as commodities ranging from iron ore to oil took a battering.</p>

                        <p>"The chances of an optimistic 2016 are bleak," Mark To, head of research at Hong Kong's Wing Fung Financial Group, said. "Slowing economic growth and structural reforms in China might contribute to decreased demand for commodities."</p>

                        <i>Thu Dec 31 2015 12:26:26 GMT+1100 (AEDT)</i>
                        <hr />

                        <p>(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)</p>

                        <p>By Andy Critchlow</p>

                        <p>LONDON, Dec 31 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Ivan Glasenberg outlasted all his major peers after the multi-year boom in metals prices turned into a rout in 2013. The Glencore &lt;GLEN.L&gt; chief's misjudgment of the market severely tried investors' patience in 2015. Yet when the second wave of mining executive ousters comes, as it may soon, it's likely Glasenberg will again be the last man standing.</p>

                        <p>Rio Tinto &lt;RIO.L&gt; &lt;RIO.AX&gt;, BHP Billiton &lt;BHP.AX&gt; &lt;BLT.L&gt; and Anglo American &lt;AAL.L&gt; all changed chief executives two years ago, as the supercycle in commodities turned out to be a myth. But the incomers - Sam Walsh, Andrew Mackenzie and Mark Cutifani - haven't been able to arrest the decline. They have cut capital expenditure, sold assets and in Anglo's case, belatedly slashed dividends. Since the beginning of 2013, their combined market value has fallen by 59 percent to $143 billion.</p>

                        <p>Glasenberg has fared no better. Glencore's shares had declined 70 percent in the year to Dec. 30. Worse, unlike rivals, the company is still laden with debt. The tough-talking Glasenberg helped to gear up Glencore at a time when Chinese demand for metals was expected to remain strong. He admits now that doing so was a mistake. Rivals' bosses have been ousted for similar missteps.</p>

                        <p>By James Regan

                        <p>SYDNEY, Dec 21 (Reuters) - BHP Billiton &lt;BHP.AX&gt; &lt;BLT.L&gt; has not received formal notification that its assets in Brazil have been frozen, a company spokesman said Monday, three days after a court ruled to hold the assets as compensation for the Samarco mining disaster.</p>

                        <p>"We have yet to receive any formal notification," BHP Billiton's Paul Hutchins said by telephone from the company's Melbourne headquarters. "We hope to have an update tomorrow."</p>

                        <p>A judge in Brazil's state of Minais Gerais on Friday froze the Brazilian assets of BHP and domestic miner Vale SA &lt;VALE5.SA&gt; after ruling their Samarco joint venture was unable to pay for damages following a dam collapse last month at Samarco's iron ore mine in the state. The disaster killed 16 people, left hundreds homeless, and polluted a nearby river.</p>
